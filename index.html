      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am currently a student at Code Fellows in Seattle studying Software Development.  My first exposure to anything tech related was in mid December of 2016 when I took the Code 101 class at Code Fellows, so I am just commencing my tech journey.  Currently, I plan to use my transferable skills from my design background to become a Front-End Developer.  This may evolve as I gain additional knowledge through the course of my studies at Code Fellows.  After completing the program, I would like to work for tech company focusing on natural health &amp; wellness.</p>
